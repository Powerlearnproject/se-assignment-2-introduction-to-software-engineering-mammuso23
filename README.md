# SE-Assignment-2
Assignment: Introduction to Software Engineering
Instructions:
Answer the following questions based on your understanding of software engineering concepts. Provide detailed explanations and examples where appropriate.

Questions:
Define Software Engineering:

What is software engineering, and how does it differ from traditional programming? 
**Answer** Software engineering is the systematic application of engineering principles, methods, and tools to the development and maintainance of high quality software systems; whereas Traditional programming focuses mostly on the actual writing of the code that is used to implement specific functionalities within a software system. (https://docs.google.com/presentation/d/1DqIQCq5Yt-JeeNfLH0ixIxtBwxpHvqWa/edit?rtpof=true&sd=true)

Software Development Life Cycle (SDLC):

Explain the various phases of the Software Development Life Cycle. Provide a brief description of each phase.
**Answer** The SDLC consist of:
Requirements: gathering and documenting user needs and system requirements.
Design: Creating high-level and detailed designs of software architecture.
Implementation: Writing code and building the software according to the design specifications
Testing: Conducting various tests to ensure the software meets quality standards and functional requirements.
Deployment: Releasing the software to users or customers.
Maintainance: Proving ongoing support, updates, and enhancements to software after deployment.

Agile vs. Waterfall Models:

Compare and contrast the Agile and Waterfall models of software development. What are the key differences, and in what scenarios might each be preferred?
**Answer** Waterfall models follow a sequencial approach with distinct phases flowing downwards.It has fixed requirements that will not be changed, has extensive documentation, and less customer interaction. The waterfall model of software development might be preferred with projects that have specific reqiuirements and a clear path from start to finish. Agile models follow a interactive and incremental approach, it is more flexible, implements collaboration and communication, and it encourages continuous improvement. The agile model of software development might be preferred for projects where customer feedback is crucial and requirements keep on changing and improving. (https://docs.google.com/presentation/d/1DqIQCq5Yt-JeeNfLH0ixIxtBwxpHvqWa/edit?rtpof=true&sd=true)

Requirements Engineering:

What is requirements engineering? Describe the process and its importance in the software development lifecycle.
**Answer** Requirements engineering is a crucial step in the SDLC that involves the process of gathering and documenting user needs and system requirements. This is to ensure that the final software product meets the needs and requirements its stakeholders and the parties involved. (https://docs.google.com/presentation/d/1DqIQCq5Yt-JeeNfLH0ixIxtBwxpHvqWa/edit?rtpof=true&sd=true) 

Software Design Principles:

Explain the concept of modularity in software design. How does it improve maintainability and scalability of software systems?
**Answer** Modularity in software design is aimed at creating a software in a way that minimizes dependencies among the components of a system. This then helps to localize the impact of changes, simplifies maintainance, and enhances the undestandability of the software system. (https://www.ituonline.com/tech-definitions/what-is-modularity-in-software-design/#:~:text=Modularity%20is%20a%20fundamental%20design,the%20understandability%20of%20the%20system.) 

Testing in Software Engineering:

Describe the different levels of software testing (unit testing, integration testing, system testing, acceptance testing). Why is testing crucial in software development?
**Answer** Each level occurs at different stages of development. 
1. Unit Testing: involves testing individual components or units of code such as function, classes, , in isolation from the rest of the application. It focuses on ensuring that each unit performs as it is expected.
2. Intergration Testing: focuses on testing the intereaction between intergrated units so that they are able to work together.
3. System Testing: it tests the complete intergrated system as a whole to verify that it meets the requirements.
4. Acceptance Testing: final level of testing that ensures that the software meets all the requirements and is ready for deployment.   
Testing is crucial in software development because it ensures that the software meets the qualitiy standards and functional requirements. (https://www.scaler.com/topics/software-testing/different-levels-of-testing-in-software-testing/#:~:text=These%20levels%20are%20based%20on,per%20the%20requirements%20he%20listed.)

Version Control Systems:

What are version control systems, and why are they important in software development? Give examples of popular version control systems and their features.
**Answer** Version Control Systems are software tools for tracking changes to source code and coordinating work among team members. e.g. Git, Subversion. (https://docs.google.com/presentation/d/1DqIQCq5Yt-JeeNfLH0ixIxtBwxpHvqWa/edit?rtpof=true&sd=true)

Software Project Management:

Discuss the role of a software project manager. What are some key responsibilities and challenges faced in managing software projects?
**Answer** A software project manager's role is to analyse project constraints, establish the project objectives, overseeing the execution and delivery of a project, coordinate the teams in and outside the project, managing the stakeholders, communicating with the parties involved, and handling the documentations. With challenges such as managing changes to project scope, resource constraints, technological challenges, and continuous improvement and learning.

Software Maintenance:

Define software maintenance and explain the different types of maintenance activities. Why is maintenance an essential part of the software lifecycle?
**Answer** Software maintaince is when ongoing support, updates, and enhancements are provided to a software after deployment. The maintaince activities: Corrective maintainance where bugs defects found in the software are fixed. Adaptive maintainance where the software is updated to work in any new environment. Perfective maintainance where the software is enhanced to improve its performance. Preventive maintainance is where the software is being improved to prevent future or possible problems. (https://www.computer.org/resources/software-maintenance/#:~:text=Software%20maintenance%20is%20an%20integral,changing%20environment%20throughout%20its%20lifetime.)

Ethical Considerations in Software Engineering:

What are some ethical issues that software engineers might face? How can software engineers ensure they adhere to ethical standards in their work?
**Answer** As software becomes entrenched in every aspect of the human experience, developers have an ethical responsibility to their customers. Ethical issues such as concerns about privacy and security, user consent, social impact, and professionalism. For example an app called Temu are facing a lawsuit alleging that it violates its customers privacy rights by private data, taking money and tracking them. Software engineers can ensure the adhere to ethical standards by adhering to the code of ethics such as Assosiation for Computing Machinery. Considering social impacts, making sure that they obtain informed consent by being transparent to their users.
